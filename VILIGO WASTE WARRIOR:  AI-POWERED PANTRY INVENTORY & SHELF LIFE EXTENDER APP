🥗 VILIGO WASTE WARRIOR: AI-POWERED PANTRY INVENTORY & SHELF LIFE EXTENDER APP

PROJECT CONTEXT
This application prototype was developed by Team Foodlings during the G-K Hackathon – Digital Campus 2.0 on Google Cloud (hosted by the KITS CSE Dept.).
The application addresses the critical challenge of **Household Food Waste and Inventory Management**, providing a sustainable solution for consumers.

💡 TECHNICAL SOLUTION & APPROACH
The application acts as a smart inventory assistant, using AI to manage pantry items and predict spoilage:
* Inventory Input: Simulates the use of  manual entry to quickly track items and initial expiry dates.
* Shelf-Life Prediction:Uses Predictive Modeling (AI/Cloud service) to adjust printed expiry dates based on user inputs regarding current storage conditions     (e.g., refrigerator temperature, air humidity).
* Actionable Alerts:Generates timely alerts when food items are approaching their predicted spoilage point.
* Recipe Suggestions:Offers recipes based on items that need to be consumed soonest, preventing waste.

✨ KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROTOTYPE
* User Authentication: Secure Sign In and Register pathways.
* Inventory Visualization: Displays real-time stock levels and shelf-life status.
* Spoilage Alerts:Provides customizable notifications for items nearing expiry.
* Data Summary: Visual representation of food waste reduction metrics and estimated savings.

🚀 TECHNOLOGY STACK
* Platform: Developed using Google Cloud services and infrastructure.
* Front-End:React(JavaScript) and Component-Based Architecture.
* Styling:Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
* Logic: Integrated with AI/Cloud services for predictive analytics and data processing.

📈 IMPACT & BUSINESS VALUE
* Sustainability: Directly supports SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by minimizing household food waste.
* Consumer Savings:Helps users save money by prioritizing consumption and reducing spoilage.
* Efficiency: Creates a streamlined, low-effort method for managing complex home inventories.
